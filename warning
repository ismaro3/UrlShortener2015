Hello,
we, Bangladesh Green Team, have detected some similarities between our code and yours, more specifically in JSON Web Tokens Code. Parts of JWTokenFilter class of “auth” package seem to be copy-pasted from our code (Same code, same comments, and even same spacing).
This is OK (Our license allows it), but our license “Apache 2.0” requires you to quote us and say that part of that code comes from our project.
So we beg you to include a little disclaimer either in your class or in your README.md saying that.
Thank you!
